# Game Development with Unity

* by Rob Madden

This course should be entitled 'Game Creation with Unity' and should be broken down into three phases.  The course will simultaneously teach object oriented programming fundamentals as illustrated by integrating C# scripts into multiple Unity game examples.  The goal of the course is to teach students the knowledge they will need to be proficient in creating an arbitrary game using the Unity game creation system and C# as their scripting tool, if we choose to teach JavaScript that is also an option.  No prior programming experience is needed for this course as the programming fundamentals will be taught in tandem to the Unity game creation platform.  We will not teach the students how to build assets in this course.  This will most likely will not be a very easy course for beginners, but I think it's doable.  Lastly, we will have to work in checkpoint for teaching revision control as I don't see any way around it.

## Phases
- A Foundation phase where students will learn the fundamentals of both C# (C Sharp) as well as the Unity cross-platform game creation system while creating their first games (one two dimensional game and one three dimensional game).  Both games are relatively trivial, the 2D game can be something like Pong which illustrates the fundamentals of Unity.  The 3D game can be something similar to the beginner demos that Unity has on their website.  By walking the student through both a 2D and 3D course in the foundation phase, we will have overlapping criteria between the two which will reaffirm their knowledge during the second game but will also illustrate the differences between 2D and 3D gaming.  After creating both games they will also have a reference to look back at for their intermediate course.

- An intermediate phase where students will build a more complex game with greater breadth and depth as well as a higher number of breakpoints and challenges.  

- Lastly an advanced phase where students build a game entirely from scratch.  We let the students choose from a pool of sophisticated games that are predetermined to have enough scope and complexity that they are challenging yet not impossible.  This can be something like minesweeper for the 2D course which has a decent amount of programmatic sophistication to some type of basic 3D RPG with multiple levels, a character, spawning enemies, health, etc.

## Expectation and Goals
Students will not find this course to be trivial, but by the time they have finished the course they will have a solid understanding of the following:
    - Revision control with git (we will have to teach this I assume)
    - Programming in C# of JavaScript
    - Building both a 2D and 3D standalone game with Unity
